# Feed Reader Testing

## Project Overview
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.
## Why this Project?
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.
## Tests
RSS Feeds:
* Feeds are Defined
* Feed URL is not empty
* Feed names are not empty

The Menu:
* The menu is hidden by default
* When clicked the menu changes visibility

Initial Entries:
* Feed container has at least 1 entry

New Feed Selection:
* Feed content changes when new feed is selected
